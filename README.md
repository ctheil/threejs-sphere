Utilizes ThreeJS and WebGL to build a sphere and pointlight. OrbitControls allow the user to rotate the sphere and interact with the light. Use interaction also generates a color based on the position of the user's clicked mouse- i.e. mouse x position selects red from 0 to 255, and y pos selects green from 0 to 255 with static blue value.
